# Arinails | Nails that shine - website

Now the site in under the domain `cenidev`, but as soon as the client wants her own domain, i'll update that.

### Simple portfolio website, where you can find her:

- Works.

- Contacts


## Structure and porpouse

On this website you can see Ari's works, her creativity and the quality of her work. You can also see the reviews that the clients gave to her, and contact Ari via [Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/ari.nailsss_) 

Here are some of her works:

The site is entirely in [HTML](index.html), using a simple [script.js](script.js) for display the projects in it and an external [CSS](styles.css) for the styles, very similar to my website [cenidev.com](https://cenidev.com).


The site has this script in the `<head>` tag for the indicization and better search powered by [Schema.org](https://schema.org/)

``` js
    "@context":"https://schema.org",
    "@type":"Person",
    "name":"Arinails",
    "jobTitle":"Nail Artist",
    "address":{"@type":"PostalAddress","addressLocality":"Firenze","addressRegion":"FI","postalCode":"50136","addressCountry":"Italy"},
    "sameAs":["https://www.instagram.com/ari.nailsss_/"],
    "url":"/"
```

In [script.js](script.js) you can find the array with all the reviews, the function that push that in the HTML and a little few lines for the dark/light themes
